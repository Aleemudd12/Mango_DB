First, remove the old repository:

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list

if Remove the old key:

sudo apt-key del 9ECBEC467F0CEB10

Import the GPG key for the current MongoDB version:


curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-6.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg \
   --dearmor

Add the MongoDB 6.0 repository for Ubuntu 22.04:


echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list

Update the package list:

sudo apt update

Install MongoDB:

sudo apt install -y mongodb-org

Start and enable the MongoDB service:

sudo systemctl start mongod
sudo systemctl enable mongod

Verify the installation:

mongod --version
This should install the current version of MongoDB on your Ubuntu 22.04 system. If you encounter any issues with these steps, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.





Edit
Great! I'm glad you've successfully installed MongoDB. Let's go through the process of adding some test data and performing basic operations. Here's a step-by-step guide:
Connect to MongoDB:

Copy

mongosh

Create a new database:
javascript

Copy
use 
testdb
Insert some sample data:
javascript

Copy
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "John Doe", age: 30, email: "john@example.com" },
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 25, email: "jane@example.com" },
  { name: "Bob Johnson", age: 35, email: "bob@example.com" }
])
Verify the data was inserted:
javascript

Copy
db.users.find()
Query specific data:
javascript

Copy
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })
Update a document:
javascript

Copy
db.users.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
Delete a document:
javascript

Copy
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Bob Johnson" })
Count documents:
javascript

Copy
db.users.countDocuments()
These are basic operations to get you started with testing.
Would you like me to explain any of these operations in more detail? Or do you have a specific testing scenario in mind that you'd like help with?
